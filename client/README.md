ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I managed to create my client using react and use express to create my server using both GET and POST endpoints. I also was able to build a form for users to create posts and have more than one page on my app and also be able to use SQL to retrieve posts from the database from the server.
I initially had 2 tables on my sql one for posts and one for comments. I was able to add the data from my 'posts' table, however on my 'comments' table when I input the data it did load up, but on the ID it shows 'NULL' so I couldnt figure out how to get it to change as I was finding it difficult.
This assignment I did find very complex and I struggled connecting everything to get it all to work and show up on my app but after collaborating with team members I managed to get it to show up and update on the database aswell. Overall my app wasnt what I originally wanted; on my 'posts' page I originally wanted it so that users can add comments on each post but I didnt have enough time to try and get that to work together on one page so at the end i put the 'comments' on a seperate page to posts.
